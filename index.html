        <blockquote>
            During the summer, our rabbit, Tonto, began to have severe redness and itching on his
            belly and feet. I'm very thankful to the veterinarians and staff at Wisdom for the
            excellent care Tonto received, and for nipping his allergies in the bud, so to speak.

        <blockquote>
            When Samantha, our Siamese cat, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively,
            we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. Now, two years later, Samantha is still
            free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal.

        <blockquote>
            The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Golden
            Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and
            provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normally.

        <blockquote>
            Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only clinic around that will even book pet fish for
            appointments. When our 13-year old Comet goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white
            to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could
            help. Wisdom not only got us in the same day, but also was able to diagnose McAllister
            as having a severe case of septicemia.
